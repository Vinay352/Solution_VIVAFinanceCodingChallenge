There are two parts to this interview: 1 coding challenge and 1 design challenge.

Part 2: Instructions may be found in part2readme.md in the directory /part2

## Please keep in mind the following points:

- Please push your solution to a private Github or Gitlab repository and invite 'alex@viva-finance.com' and 'jacob@viva-finance.com'
- Please send an email to 'alex@viva-finance.com' and 'jacob@viva-finance.com' when the solution is complete, with a link to the private repository
- Please respond with that link within the 24 hours of when you receive the challenge.
- Please know you are not expected to need a full day to complete the challenge. It is designed to be completed in less than 2 hours, we just feel that this format gives you more flexibility than a live, timed interview.
- You are welcome to use the internet for referencing code documentation and other resources you would use in your normal development flow, but please only submit your own work.
- While we use Node.js at Viva, feel free to use the language you are the most comfortable with. That said, please use only the standard library of the language you choose. We will run the code with whatever language you specify but will not be installing any dependencies.
- Please provide a readme detailing how to run your solution from the command line.
